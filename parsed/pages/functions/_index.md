# Functions
The Cloudflare documentation team is running a survey to measure the effectiveness of the Pages documentation. If you use the Pages documentation to build your projects, we want to hear from you.
To contribute, [complete the survey](https://forms.gle/ufDHpP9YvqTzJzXC7) (total time: 1 minute, 4 mandatory questions).
Thank you for your support.
Pages Functions allows you to build full-stack applications by executing code on the Cloudflare network with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, handling form submissions, or working with middleware. Use Functions to deploy server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.
To feedback or ask questions on Functions, join the [Cloudflare Developers Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev) and connect with the Cloudflare team in the [#functions channel](https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/910978223968518144).
