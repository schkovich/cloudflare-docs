The Cloudflare documentation team is running a survey to measure the effectiveness of the Pages documentation. If you use the Pages documentation to build your projects, we want to hear from you.
To contribute, [complete the survey](https://forms.gle/ufDHpP9YvqTzJzXC7) (total time: 1 minute, 4 mandatory questions).
Thank you for your support.
Cloudflare Pages is super fast, always up to date. Deploy your project by connecting to [your Git provider](/pages/get-started/guide/#connect-your-git-provider-to-pages), uploading prebuilt assets directly to Pages with [Direct Upload](/pages/get-started/direct-upload/) or using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pages) from the command line.
## Features
Use Pages Functions to deploy server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.
Rollbacks allow you to instantly revert your project to a previous production deployment.
Set up redirects for your Cloudflare Pages project.
